## Purpose
The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my current skills as an aspiring web developer.

<br>

## Functionality/features
This website was created to be fully responsive so that it can be access on various devices without the user experience being disrupted. It also applied many semantics for organizational purposes. The website design was kept minimalistic yet fun through uses of font, effect, animation, and colour in order to captivate the audience's attention. For the theme, I wanted to create a game-like interface which will transport the audience back to their childhood

The website features 4 pages and a footer which contains links to my social media:
1. Home: Main homepage which includes my animated profile and a brief introduction of myself.
2. About: A more in-depth introduction to me. Includes my resume.
3. Project: Will feature projects that I will be working on.
4. Blogs: Include 5 blog pages
